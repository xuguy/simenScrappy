You are now a helpfull assitance. You are required to perform a web scrapping task using python. You task is to access a web page via a url and get a piece of text on that page. The text we want can be find by parsing the html code, as shown in the attached picture. Write python code to perform this task, leave the url undetermined so than the code can be adpated to many different similar pages.

title: using kaggle computing platform to run a web scrapping project.

files description:
1. simenScrap.ipynb and scrap.py are 2 runnable code files, the content of them are basically the same, we need a .ipynb so that codes can be run on kaggle.

2. simenSteamID.csv is the data of the first 1000 users of Simen, deprecated, do not use it.

3. test-notebook.log and testOutputFile.csv is the output of the test code run on kaggle, we download them from kaggle using kaggle kernels output xgy2718/test-notebook (standard procedure)

procedure:
1. prepare all codes and test on local machine, make sure codes are runnable.

2. kaggle init to create kernel-metadata.json, fill in necessary info

3. kaggle push, upload .ipynb to kaggle and run.

4. kaggle kernels output xgy2718/test-notebook, to download output generated by our codes.

problem:
1. we target webpage located in China, but kaggle not in China, so access through internet denied by targeted page. This means we cannot run our code on kaggle.

2. so we give up running the web scrapping notebook on kaggle, but instead testing whether other codes are runnable and output as expected.
